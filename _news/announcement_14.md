In Feb 2024, I will give an invited talk on parameter-free optimisation on the space of probability measures at the [Isaac Newton Institute](https://www.newton.ac.uk/) workshop on [Accelerating statistical inference and experimental design with machine learning](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/rclw03/).
