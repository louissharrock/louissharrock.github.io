I will be giving a talk on some ongoing work with [Nikolas Kantas](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/), [Panos Parpas](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pp500/index.html), and [Greg Pavliotis](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~pavl/) on online parameter estimation for interacting particle systems using single trajectory data at the SIAM Conference on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ24), to be held in Trieste, Italy in February 2024.
