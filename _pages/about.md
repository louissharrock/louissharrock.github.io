**About**. I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-statistical-science">Department of Statistical Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>. I was previously a Senior Research Associate with <a href="https://chris-nemeth.github.io/">Prof. Chris Nemeth</a> at Lancaster University, and a Data Science Heilbronn Research Fellow at the University of Bristol. I obtained my PhD in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, supervised by <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/">Dr. Nikolas Kantas</a>. I also hold an MRes in Mathematics and an MSc in Statistics from Imperial College London, and an MA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge.

**Research**. My research interests lie at the intersection of computational statistics, machine learning, and optimisation, with a particular focus on the design and analysis of scalable algorithms for statistical inference in complex statistical models. My current research focuses on the development of learning-rate-free sampling algorithms, the application of score-based diffusion models to likelihood-free inference, and the design of efficient methods for online parameter estimation in interacting particle systems and mean-field equations.  

**Prospective Students**. I welcome inquiries from motivated students interested in pursuing a PhD. If you are interested in working with me, I encourage you to take a closer look at my [publication list](https://louissharrock.github.io/publications/) and get in touch if you see a good fit. Further information for prospective students is available [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/prospective-postgraduates/phd).
