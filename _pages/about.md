**About**. I am a Senior Research Associate in Statistical Machine Learning working with <a href="https://chris-nemeth.github.io/">Prof. Chris Nemeth</a> at Lancaster University, and an Honorary Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol. I was previously a Data Science Heilbronn Research Fellow at the University of Bristol. I obtained my PhD in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, supervised by <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/">Dr. Nikolas Kantas</a>. I hold an MRes in Mathematics and an MSc in Statistics from Imperial College London, and an MA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge.

**Research**. My research interests include computational statistics, machine learning, and optimisation, with a particular focus on stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and likelihood free inference. My current research focuses on learning-rate free sampling algorithms, score-based methods for simulation based inference, and online inference for interacting particle systems and mean-field equations.
